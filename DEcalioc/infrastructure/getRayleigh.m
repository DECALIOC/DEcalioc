function dtr = getRayleigh(r, rho, YM, nu)
  % INFO
  % Caluclates the Rayleigh-time dt_R. Returns ZERO if calculation fails.
  % Has to be multiplied by 0.1 ... 0.3 to get the Rayleigh-time-step. 
  %
  % args:
  %   - r: particle radius
  %   - rho: density
  %   - YM: Young's modulus (particle)
  %   - nu: Poisson's ratio (particle)
  % returns:
  %   - dtr: Rayleigh-time (not time-step, i.e. w/o mutiplication of 0.25)
  
  SM = YM ./ (2*(1+nu));
  A = sqrt(rho./SM);
  B = 1./(0.1631*nu + 0.8766);
  dtr = pi .* r .* A .* B;
